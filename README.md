2D-ShallowWater-WAF
===================

Dam-break modelling

this is a matlab version of dam break model HW_WAFCU from Toro, which
modelling the 2D dam break problem basing on the shallow water equations.

A TVD WAF scheme is used.The multi-dimensional problem is solved by the unsplit method.

Ini.mat contains the input data.

A gif "DamBreak" will be produced to show the results.

The computation time is a little long, so be patient.
